# Free Comptia Sec+ course
Hello friend,

Welcome to this free CompTIA Security+ course. My name is h0neyp0t, and in this post, I will introduce you to what this course is about. If you want to know if this course is right for you, please read the entire article.
Disclaimer:

Before you continue, there are a few things to consider:

    The goal of this training is not to help you pass the certification. Rather, I use the Security+ certification to provide you with structured content. Cybersecurity covers numerous topics, and it’s easy to get overwhelmed.

    This is not a mindless copy-paste of the resources I have at my disposal. Rather, it’s what I have understood from them. As Lavoisier said, “Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.”

    I’m not perfect, so this course may not be perfect.

    Each chapter will be available in PDF format, hosted on Mega or a similar platform.

    The ultimate goal is to generate a completely free and visually appealing e-book.

Why am I doing this?

I’m doing this for you, and I’m also doing this for me. Let me explain:
For you:

    To break down as many barriers to access to education as possible:

    Budget: if you don’t want/can’t spend +$2000 on a boot camp

    Social class

    Ethnicity: cybersec is open to all regardless of skin color

    To give anyone a chance to learn

    To balance form and substance as much as possible. Many courses, whether free or paid, are either very boring, difficult to understand, or empty.

    To give you a chance to become l33t. 😎

For me:

    To challenge myself to teach others.

    To challenge myself to not only start new projects but also to finish them.

    To learn more about cybersecurity, just like you.

    To get rid of the “toxic” perfectionism, which is killing my productivity.

    To learn English because this is not my mother tongue. Je parle français à la base mdr

What’s covered ?

The course covers all the CompTIA Security+ objective domains:

    Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities

    Architecture and Design

    Implementation

    Operations and Incident Response

    Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Questions you may ask:

    “Is this 100% free? Or is it going to be 20% free and I have to pay for the extra 80%?”

This course is completely free. The whole thing, 100% of it. I don’t ask you for money for this.

    “Why do this when there are already resources available on the internet (including official resources)?”

I think that there are already a lot of resources available on the internet, but it’s not always easy to understand for everyone.

Everyone is different, and everyone interprets things differently. This is why I think having a plethora of teachers with their style of teaching is something good. Just choose the one you like, whether it’s me or not. 😁

    “At what frequency will a new chapter be available?”

Roughly every two weeks. It could be a little more or a little less. I do this in my free time. :)

    “Why not post everything at once?”

I want to give you some time to understand the topics covered. Cybersecurity can be very nebulous.

    “Are you going to do the same with other certifications?”

If I receive good feedback, and if people are learning new things because of me, I may do this again!

    “Why did you say that the goal is not to pass the certification? What’s the point of calling this ‘CompTIA Sec+ free course’?”

As I said, I’m only using the Security+ certification because of the structured content. I’m only trying to extract its value.
Who is it for?

    For the mother whose business took a hit and who wants to deepen her knowledge to change fields;

    For the teenager with $0 in their pocket and a thirst for knowledge;

    For the entrepreneur who can’t afford to neglect their clients;

    For the guy already working in the IT field who wants to improve their skills;

    For the person who has always been discouraged from entering the world of cybersecurity;

    For anyone with curiosity !

Don’t settle for null, strive for #0…
